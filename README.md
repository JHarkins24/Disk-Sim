# Disk_Sim

In this project, I implement a disk simulator that  then turn's into a character based device for which  
will subsequently write a driver and install it in Linux as a kernel module.

This project must be implemented on Linux, since it uses Linux-specific ways to implement both the drivers and kernel modules.
